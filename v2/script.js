He'd seen a thousand storms lash against the craggy cliffs, but this one felt different, a primal unease settling in his bones. The wind howled a mournful song, rattling the ancient panes of glass in the tower. He checked the lamp, its beam a steadfast sentinel against the encroaching darkness. Down below, the waves crashed with a fury that threatened to swallow the small island whole. Silas sipped his lukewarm tea, the bitter taste oddly comforting amidst the tempest. Heâ€™d weathered worse, he told himself, but a shiver, born not of cold but of something far deeper, ran down his spine. The storm, he felt, held more than just wind and rain."
